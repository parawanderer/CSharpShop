# CSharpShop: 2020 Experiment

I wrote this wile following a course in 2020 to learn C#.

This is a very legacy style project using `ASP.NET` / `JQuery` (wow, haven't thought of this in a while!) / `Bootstrap` / `Microsoft SQL Server`

Honestly don't remember too many details by now lol. Making this repo public for the sake of transparency/history/whatever because I own the rights to the code.

It used to have jquery and bootstrap in a subdirectory, which messed up the github-computed source code types percentage. So I got rid of the content of those files to have it not count non-me-written code in this way.
